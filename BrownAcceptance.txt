Congratulations! I am delighted to inform you that the Board of Admission has voted to admit you to Brown University's Class of 2021. The Board has carefully reviewed more than 32,000 applicants and has selected those individuals who, as members of the Class of 2021, will bring to Brown an extraordinary array of talents and interests. You and your 1,665 classmates will be welcomes into a vital and vibrant community of scholars and leaders with a centuries-old tradition of academic excellence. You were chosen not only for what we believe you can contribute to our academic community, but also for what you will gain from the wonderful opportunities that distinguish and define undergraduate education at Brown.

You will receive an official admission decision letter and packet in the mail. Be sure to visit our website for admitted students to learn more about Brown, including information about our campus visitation program: A Day on College Hill. We hope you are able to join us.

Beginning on March 31 you may notify us of your decision by logging back into this site. The deadline to reply is May 1. Prior to your enrollment next fall we expect you to maintain academic and social records of the same high quality that you have demonstrated in your career thus far. If you have any questions between now and your matriculation, do not hesitate to ask us.

On behalf of the entire Brown community, please accept my congratulations on your admission and we look forward to welcoming you to campus next fall.

Sincerely,

Logan Powell
Dean of Admission
