Congratulations! I am delighted to offer you admission to Princeton's Class of 2021. Earlier today we mailed you a detailed letter of admission and a folder of information. Included in this mailing is an invitation for you and your parents or guardians to participate in one of two upcoming Princeton Preview programs. These events will be held on campus to showcase the academic, residential and cultural aspects of Princeton.

If you applied for financial aid, a message from the Financial Aid Office is included below. You will find more extensive information about your financial aid award in the mailing you will receive.

We encourage you to explore the website we have created for admitted students: https://admitted.princeton.edu. To access this website, you will need the same username and password you used to view this online decision. The admitted student website will be available until the end of April. It will allow you to register online for one of the Princeton Preview programs, create a personal profile, read about other admitted students and participate in blogs by some of our current students. You also may use this website to let us know your final decision by May 1.

Let me remind you that your admission to Princeton is contingent upon the successful completion of your senior year. We expect that you will keep up the high academic standards and good conduct you have maintained throughout high school.

We are so pleased to offer you admission to Princeton's Class of 2021.

Congratulations again!

Sincerely,

Janet Levin Rapelye
Dean of Admission
