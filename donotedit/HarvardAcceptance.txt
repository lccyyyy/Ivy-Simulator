Congratulations on your admission to Harvard! I hope you will join us in Cambridge this August as a member of the Class of 2021. You can now access our admitted students site, where you will see a special message of congratulations and find more information about academic and student life.

Our admissions committee considers each application with great care, voting to admit those who will make the best use of the opportunities at Harvard. We admire all you have accomplished, and we believe that Harvard is a particularly good match for your talents and interests.

Our faculty and students extend a special invitation for you to stay in Harvard Yard and the Harvard Houses during VISITAS. At this weekend-long celebration, you will meet current undergraduates, faculty, and other members of the Class of 2021. Please register for VISITAS by April 10.

We ask that you reply to our offer of admission by May 1. Our revolutionary financial aid program makes it possible for all admitted students to attend. If you have any questions or concerns about affording a Harvard education, please email us.

Again, congratulations! We hope to see you at Harvard!

Sincerely,

William R. Fitzsimmons
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid
