After a thoughtful consideration of your candidacy, the Admissions Committee has denied your application to join Dartmouth’s Class of 2021.

I know this was not the outcome you hoped to receive and I appreciate your disappointment. While many candidates for admission to Dartmouth could thrive academically and personally at the College, sheer numbers required us to make difficult decisions as we evaluated more than 20,000 applications for the 1,120 available seats in our next first­year class. Regrettably, that ratio prevented us from selecting more candidates from the pool of talented and promising students who submitted an application this year.

Thank you for the compliment of your interest in Dartmouth, and please accept our very best wishes for a successful college experience.

Sincerely,

Lee Coffin
Vice Provost for Enrollment and Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid
Dartmouth College
