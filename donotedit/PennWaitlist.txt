The selection committee has completed its deliberations, and it cannot offer you admission to the University of Pennsylvania at this time. However, given your extraordinary talents and personal achievements, I would like to offer you a position on our waiting list.

Very truly yours,

Eric J. Furda C'87
Dean of Admissions
