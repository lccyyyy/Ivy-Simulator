The admissions selection committee has reviewed your application for admission for the fall of 2017, and I sincerely regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you admission to Cornell University.

I want to assure you that we gave your application a very thorough and careful review before making this difficult decision. Cornellâ€™s admission selection process was especially competitive this year given the high number of applications received. It is important to keep in mind that the vast majority of the more than 47,000 applicants could be successful students at Cornell. Unfortunately, with an expected class size of 3,275, enrollment limitations require us to make difficult admission decisions.

Please understand that this decision is not a reflection of your potential. College admission is very competitive and quite subjective. My colleagues and I are confident that you will find your home and experience success at another outstanding institution. On behalf of the University, I appreciate your interest in Cornell and extend my best wishes to you for success during your collegiate years.

Sincerely,

Shawn L. Felton
Director of Undergraduate Admissions
Cornell University
