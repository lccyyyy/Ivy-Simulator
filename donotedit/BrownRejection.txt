The Brown Board of Admission has completed its evaluation of more than 32,000 applications to the Class of 2021, and it is with great regret that we must inform you that your application could not be included among our acceptances.

We understand how disappointing this news must be, but we are deeply humbled that you chose to apply and grateful to have had the opportunity to learn more about you. The great majority of the young men and women who applied to Brown this year are clearly capable of performing well academically and of making significant contributions to the college community in other ways. With more than twenty candidates for every available space, the Board's task in selecting the Class of 2021 has been extremely difficult. We want to acknowledge your accomplishments and to reiterate how much care we have taken in the admission process to get to know all of our applicants, and how difficult it therefore is to deny so many.

Please remember that in the long run where you go to college is far less important than what you do with the opportunities that surely will come your way. You have our best wishes for success in your college plans.

Sincerely,

Logan Powell
Dean of Admission
