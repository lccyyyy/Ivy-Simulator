On behalf of President Amy Gutmann and the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, I am delighted to inform you of your admission to Penn's 265th class. You have been selected for study in the College of Arts and Sciences.

Your application reflected your extraordinary potential, and you are now poised to magnify that potential at Penn. Our eminent faculty, who are deeply committed to undergraduate education, stand ready to guide your own exploration across the curriculum. Our alumni who feel an unshakable gratitude for all that Penn has contributed to their lives, hearts and minds, are eager to introduce you to Penn's rich, historic tradition of innovation and impact.

Benjamin Franklin, our founder, said, "The great aim and end of all learning is service to society." This statement powers our community with a sense of purpose, ensuring that we seek to engage, to create and connect, and to act. Having seen the uncommon quality of your achievement and character through your application, we recognize that your talents will contribute immeasurably to these efforts. In short, Penn will not be the same without you.

I join with your family and mentors in celebrating this extraordinary moment with you. So many people have contributed to your achievement; please take time to acknowledge their efforts in the days to come. Reflect with them on the challenge this letter presents to you: through their support and your hard work, you now have the opportunity to make a lasting mark on Benjamin Franklin's great University. I know I share their hopeful anticipation - we cannot wait to see the nature and magnitude of the mark you decide to leave.

I look forward to our encounters on Locust Walk in the coming years, but in the meantime, I send my sincere well wishes and deep gratitude for your application. Welcome to Penn!

Very truly yours,

Eric J. Furda C'87
