Welcome to Yale College! It is with the greatest enthusiasm that I write to congratulate you on your admission to the Class of 2021. You have every reason to feel proud on your accomplishment, and I am delighted at the prospect that you will join our community next fall.

For over three hundred years, Yale's motto "Lux et Veritas" - "Light and Truth" - has guided Yale students, faculty, and alumni in their pursuit of knowledge and leadership. As a Yale student you will engage astonishing intellectual, cultural, and scientific resources. Your Yale education will equip you with the knowledge and wisdom to make an impact in any field, anywhere in the world.

The Yale experience is shaped by the people who make up its community. It is a place of belonging, respect, and friendship, where diversity and fellowship reinforce each other. I know who your fellow students will be, and I am confident you will not find in one place a more diverse, talented, and aspiring company of peers.

We invite you and your future classmates to explore Yale during an on-campus event this April: Bulldog Saturday or Bulldog Days. Additional information and registration are available on the admitted student website: admits.yale.edu. When you are ready, you may reply to our offer of admission by completing the online reply form on your status portal. You must reply by May 1, but you may notify us as soon as you have made a decision. If you have any questions about Yale or the decision process, please contact us at bulldog@yale.edu.

We hope you will choose to join us in New Haven, and we look forward to celebrating your unique contribution to the University's traditions, life, and mission. It is clear from your application that you are a person who lives for challenge, for excellence, and for making a difference in the world. Congratulations again on your achievements so far. We look forward to what is still to come.

Best wishes,

Jeremiah Quinlan
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions
