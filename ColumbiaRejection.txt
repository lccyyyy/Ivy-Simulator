The Committee on Admissions has carefully reviewed your application to Columbia University, and we are sorry to inform you that we cannot offer you a place in Columbia's Class of 2021. This year more than 37,000 candidates applied for places in the first-year class, making this the most difficult selection process in our history. The many strengths of the entire applicant pool - as demonstrated by scholastic successes achieved, community service performed, activities pursued, essays written and books read - made the selection process more competitive than simple numbers could possibly indicate, which sadly compels us to disappoint many talented and appealing students.

We want you to know that this decision in no way reflects a lack of confidence in your ability to achieve success in your college plans and throughout life. Our experience is that the vast majority of students who do not gain admission here go on to distinguish themselves at fine colleges and universities throughout the world, and we are confident that you will do so as well. We must make clear, however, that since our decisions are made after many hours of careful assessment and deliberation, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions cannot consider any review of this decision.

We appreciate your interest in Columbia and wish you the best in your pursuit of higher education.

Sincerely,

Jessica Marinaccio
Dean of Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid
