Thank you for your application to Cornell University.

We know that you are anxious to learn whether or not you have been admitted to Cornell, but we are unable to give you a final decision at this time. After reviewing your application very carefully, we are placing your name on our wait list for the the College of Arts and Sciences.

We ask that you let us know if you would like to remain on our wait list and be considered for admission should additional openings become available in the freshman class. If you would like to remain on our wait list, please complete the short form at http://admissions.cornell.edu/waitlistreply by April 10. You will also find important information about our wait list on this site.

We are sorry that we cannot provide you with a final decision now. Given our large and competitive applicant pool, the selection of the freshman class was a very difficult process. We appreciate your continued interest in Cornell, and we hope that you will choose to remain on our wait list.

In the meantime, we wish you all the best.

Sincerely,

Shawn L. Felton
Director of Undergraduate Admissions
Cornell University
